# xdm-jest

Fighting that good fight trying to bring ESM forward in the world. 🌎

* Run `npm start` to see working example with output.
* Run `npm test` to _try_ and use jest to test, but it throws an error.

Jest [should be configured](/jest.config.js) to use it's [experimental support for ESM](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules), but it's not working. 🙁
